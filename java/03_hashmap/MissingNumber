LeetCode: 268 - Missing Number
Difficulty: Easy
Category:
Date: 01-06-2026

Problem Summary:
Given an array nums containing n distinct numbers in the range [0, n], return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

Example 1:
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2

Explanation:
n = 3 since there are 3 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,3]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2

Explanation:
n = 2 since there are 2 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,2]. 2 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Example 3:
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8

Explanation:

n = 9 since there are 9 numbers, so all numbers are in the range [0,9].
8 is the missing number in the range since it does not appear in nums.

Constraints:
n == nums.length
1 <= n <= 104
0 <= nums[i] <= n
All the numbers of nums are unique.

Follow up: Could you implement a solution using only O(1) extra space complexity and O(n) runtime complexity?

------------------------------------------------------------

Approach 1: Brute Force
- Idea: HashMap
  <Plain-English description> Missing number from the given nums array will
  be the one that is not present in the HashSet.

- Time Complexity:
  O(n)

- Space Complexity:
  O(n)

Approach 2: Optimized
- Idea:
  <Pattern-based explanation, not data structure name>

- Time Complexity:
  O(?)

- Space Complexity:
  O(?)

Key Insight:
<Exactly ONE sentence explaining why the optimized approach works>
